# Odin-Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch project

Project that leverages DOM manipulation to generate a sketch grid.

Calling this one done for now because I've spent enough time on it and I'm eager to get back to learning more theory. Fun project but I will need to come back and refactor the JS and CSS if I ever want to put this on a portfolio.
